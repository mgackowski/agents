# agents
(2018) An agent-based simulation. Second (better) attempt after getting some work experience in Java.

As described in last year's repo:
*A work in progress Java program taking direct inspiration and guidance from an article by Robert Zubek, titled "Needs-Based AI". It is an attempt to implement the proposed needs-based "AI" system in Java using threading. Agents have deteriorating needs and will attempt to satisfy them based on what objects and actions are available to them. By adding more objects and associating actions with them, the number of possibilities is greatly extended, and the agents should be able to manage and still make decisions without any modification to them.*
